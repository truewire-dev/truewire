"""Base endpoint class for every one of Kraken's WebSocket v2 leaves reached over one
`KrakenSocketClient` connection: trading-method request/reply calls (`trading_ws.*`,
`streams.market_data.ping`) and channel subscriptions (`streams.market_data.*` other
than `ping`, `streams.private.*`) alike.

One core class providing both `request()` (design §2) and `subscribe()` (design §8) is
needed because a `router.json`'s `core` resolves once per directory, and
`streams.market_data` itself mixes both wire dialects -- `ping` (request/reply) among
six channel subscriptions -- so its own resolved core needs both verbs (design §5's "a
resolved core class only ever needs to provide the call verb(s) actually exercised by
the endpoints beneath its position in the tree"; here that's both, not because every
single leaf needs both, but because the directory as a whole does).
