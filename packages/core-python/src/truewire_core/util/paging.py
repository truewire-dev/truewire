"""
Resumable, retry-safe pagination: a walk is a pure `next(state)` step, not a generator.

A generated `<method>_paged` returns a `PaginatedResponse` rather than an async generator
because a generator that raises is dead: nothing can retry the one page that failed and
carry on. Here every page is one call to `next(state)`, and the contract below is what
makes calling it again safe.

The contract every `next` must honour:

- `next` is a pure function of `state`. It reads no closure variable, no instance
  attribute, no clock. Calling it twice with the same `state` makes the same request.
- `state` fully determines the request. Any bound the API would otherwise default at
  call time is pinned into `init` once, before the first page.
- The request is a read. Repeating it never changes anything upstream.

Under that contract a caller may retry `next(state)` after a transient failure, resume a
walk from any page's `Page.next`, or run two iterations of one response concurrently,
and see exactly the pages a single uninterrupted walk would have produced.

  A paginated walk: `init` is the first page's state, `next` fetches one page from a
  state and returns its rows plus the following state, `None` once the walk is done.

  Awaitable (flattens every page into one list) and async-iterable (one page's rows at a
  time, empty pages skipped). `pages()` additionally exposes each page's own state, for
  checkpointing; `resume()` restarts from a saved one; `via()` routes every page fetch
  through a caller-supplied invoker, which is how a retry or logging layer wraps each
  page as one ordinary coroutine call without ever unrolling the loop by hand.

  `next` must honour the contract in this module's docstring: pure in `state`, no clock,
  read-only on the wire. Nothing here can enforce it, but everything here assumes it.

  Examples:
    ```python
    paging = client.account.trades_paged(symbol='BTCUSDT')
    trades = await paging                       # every row, flattened
    async for rows in paging: ...               # one page at a time
    async for page in paging.via(retried).pages():
      checkpoint(page.next)                     # resumable later via paging.resume(...)
