  ### Features
  - Connection handling
  - Optional periodic pinging
  - Message listener
  - Error propagation via `.wait(...)`

  ### Requires implementing
  - `on_msg`: handle incoming messages.
  - `ping`: if you the server requires some custom pinging mechanism

  ### Concurrency Contract
  1. Connection: single owner via `async with`, also supports lazy no-owner use
  2. Requests: many concurrent `wait()` calls OK

  ### Error Propagation

  The websocket connection could fail without you knowing.
  To avoid that happening, you can ensure they are propagated by using `.wait(...)`.

  **Example**:

  ```python
  future = asyncio.Future()

  class MySocket(Socket):
    def on_msg(self, msg: str | bytes):
      future.set_result(msg)

  async with MySocket('wss://example.com') as ws:
    result = await ws.wait(future)
  ```

  If you awaited directly and an exception happened, you would wait forever.
  
  This way, if an error happens, a `NetworkError` will be raised.
