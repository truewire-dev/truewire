"""
Pin `Socket`'s lazy connection contract.

`docs/production_guidelines.md`'s "Core And Instantiation" promises that entering a
client opens nothing, first use of a transport opens exactly that transport, and exiting
closes exactly what was opened -- closing nothing when nothing was. `Socket.__aenter__`
used to call `await self.open()` unconditionally, and `Socket.__aexit__` closed via
`await self.ctx`, whose property falls through to `open()` -- so exiting a socket that
was never entered-and-used dialled out just to hang up. Both are fixed by making
`__aenter__` a no-op and `__aexit__` a guard on `ctx_future.done()`.

These tests run against a `Socket` subclass whose `force_open` is a call-recorder, never a
real `websockets.connect`. The regression test for the finding above uses a subclass whose
`force_open` raises, so any code path that still reaches it fails loudly instead of quietly
opening a socket.
