# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (2026-09-07)

First release. `truewire init | import openapi | check | examples | surface | generate python |
mock | mcp | standards | docs`: a directory-per-endpoint spec format with an 18-rule linter,
recorded-example coverage with honest `unverified` reasons, an HTTP and WebSocket mock server
that replays recorded examples, a Python generator with runtime validation and pagination
walkers, an OpenAPI 3.0/3.1 importer, and an MCP server that exposes a project's endpoints
as tools. `init` writes a `pyproject.toml` so the generated client installs with
`pip install -e .`.
